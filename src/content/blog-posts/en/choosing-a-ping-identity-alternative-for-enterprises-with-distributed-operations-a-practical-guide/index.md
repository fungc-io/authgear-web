## Why companies look beyond Ping Identity

Ping Identity is a mature platform that excels at workforce SSO, complex federation and enterprise lifecycle management. Yet buyers often find it misaligned for other scenarios.

- **Complexity for simple needs.** Many Ping deployments are built around workforce IAM and federated SSO. Extending that model to large populations of mobile-first workers (shop staff, clinic nurses, drivers) creates unnecessary overhead.
- **Workforce-centric assumptions.** Ping is typically designed for personal corporate devices, email-based enrollment, and desktop/laptop workflows - not phone-first authentication or SMS-based enrollment.
- **Cost and licensing model.** Pricing structures aimed at corporate seats or SSO can make large mobile workforce deployments expensive.   <ul><li>**Multi-region operational gaps.** Data residency, and localized identity providers (government eIDs)

### When to evaluate an alternative

- Expanding to customer-facing or large mobile-first populations
- Need for local data hosting, regional SLAs, or specific compliance (e.g., local government ID integration)
- High TCO under per-seat or per-license pricing models
- Requirement for mobile-first workflows, SMS enrollment, or intermittent connectivity support

## Evaluation criteria for enterprises and mobile-first staff

<!--FIGURE-->
![](./figure-2.webp)
<!--/FIGURE-->

Standard CIAM/IAM checklists (security, UX, scalability) are necessary but insufficient for globally distributed, mobile-first workforces. Expand evaluation to include mobile and multi-region nuances.

### Key criteria and what to ask

#### Use-case fit: mobile-first & device-light users

- Does the vendor support **mobile-first authentication** with native iOS and Android SDKs?
- Are there SMS-first and one-tap enrollment flows that do not require email?
- Can you integrate **ID badges** or local smartcards?
- How does the vendor handle account recovery for non-email users?

#### Security that fits operations: adaptive & passkey alternatives

- Does the platform support **passkeys** on mobile devices, and alternative secure flows where they are not supported?
- Are there **adaptive authentication** controls (geo/behavior signals) that avoid high-friction steps for low-risk staff actions?
- Are fallback flows robust (e.g., one-time codes, operator-assisted verification)?

#### Architecture, performance, and multi-region availability

- Are there **multi-region hosting** options or local cloud footprints?
- What is the vendor's **SLA**, and are there region-specific SLAs or support hours?
- How is **latency** measured and mitigated (edge caching, replicated sessions)?

#### Data residency, privacy, and local compliance

- Can customer data be kept within the required jurisdiction?
- Does the vendor provide **auditable consent capture**, retention controls, and data export for audits?
- What certifications (ISO, SOC 2) and local legal support do they provide?

#### Developer experience and operational admin

- Are there SDKs for mobile and web, low-code UI components, and easy webhook integrations?
- Is the admin console design user-friendly?
- How good is the **documentation** and sample apps for mobile-first flows?

#### Pricing, TCO, and procurement

- Pricing model: per-seat vs MAU vs per-device vs per-auth?
- Does vendor pricing scale to very large mobile workforce populations affordably?
- Are there hidden costs for regional hosting, localization, or integrations?

### Scoring rubric (quick)

- **5** = Excellent fit for mobile-first/multi-region needs
- **3** = Good for standard CIAM but requires workarounds
- **1** = Poor fit

Use this rubric during vendor demos to rate vendors across the checklist.

## Migration playbook: moving from Ping Identity (or similar) to a new platform

A practical, phased plan reduces risk. Below is a high-level playbook and a sample timeline (8-12 weeks typical for a POC + phased rollout for mobile-first use cases).

### 1. Discovery & planning (Week 0-2)

- Inventory: identity providers, user directories, authentication methods, and integrations
- Stakeholders: security, ops, managers, legal, HR
- Define success metrics: onboarding time, auth success rate, helpdesk calls, latency
- Choose sample pilot sites and device classes (personal mobile, feature phone, tablet)

### 2. Design (Week 2-4)

- Map identity model (users, badges, devices)
- Define enrollment and recovery flows for non-email users (SMS, WhatsApp, admin-assisted)
- Compliance mapping: data residency, consent capture, retention

### 3. POC & integration (Week 4-6)

- Implement core flows with the new platform (example: phone number enrollment, mobile login, SMS fallback)
- Integrate SAML/OIDC for interoperability with existing SSO apps where needed
- Run security tests: pen test and basic threat modeling for new flows

### 4. Pilot & measure (Week 6-8)

- Deploy pilot to selected locations
- Collect KPIs: average onboarding time, authentication success, helpdesk tickets
- Observe field operator issues; iterate

### 5. Phased rollout (Week 8-12+)

- Expand using phased cohorts; shadow mode for a percentage of users
- Dual-run and token exchange: keep Ping for workforce SSO and gradually switch mobile workforce authentication
- Production cutover and decommission timeline

### 6. Post-launch & optimization

- Ongoing monitoring, audit logs, and SLA reviews
- Training refreshers and local-language documentation

### Cutover strategies for mobile authentication

**Staged approach:** pilot one region/location, then a "dark launch" stage where traffic is mirrored.

**Shadow mode:** validate new auth events against old system without affecting users.

**Token exchange:** issue tokens in the new platform, validate against legacy sessions for transition.

**Rollback:** keep a tested rollback plan and ensure you can re-enable Ping SSO rapidly if critical issues arise.

### Operational readiness & training for mobile-first staff

- Create simple one-page job aids with screenshots (local language)
- Train managers on one-click account recovery and SMS/WhatsApp enrollment assistance
- Provide a quick helpline and step-by-step scripts for staff and managers
- Monitor real-world helpdesk call types and refine flows to remove friction

### Authgear migration checklist (sample)

- Confirm SAML/OIDC compatibility with existing apps
- Test SMS/WhatsApp delivery in all regions (carrier lists, sender IDs)
- Verify regional data residency settings and obtain legal sign-off
- Run POC with at least 50 real mobile workforce users

## Region-specific considerations and regulatory checklist

Identity programs must be geo-aware. Below are practical checks by region.

### EU/EEA (GDPR)

- Confirm legal basis for processing and maintain consent records
- Ensure data residency or lawful transfer mechanisms (SCCs) for cross-border processing
- Provide data subject request processes (access, deletion)
- **Authgear note:** configurable data residency and built-in audit events support compliance

### APAC

- **Local hosting and latency:** use local cloud regions to reduce latency
- **Government ID integrations:** support for regional eID or identity exchange APIs varies; map integration requirements early
- **Language and UX:** localize enrollment prompts and SMS templates for local languages and character sets

### LATAM & Africa

- **Local SMS delivery:**vet gateway partners and sender IDs for reliable OTP delivery
- **Language and UX:**localize enrollment prompts and SMS templates

### General regulatory checklist

- **Data residency:** can you host data where regulation requires it?
- **Consent & audit:** capture consent and maintain logs for tribunal/audit
- **Certifications:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, or regionally relevant certifications
- **Local legal counsel review:** integrate early
