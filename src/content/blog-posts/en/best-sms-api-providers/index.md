faq:
  - q: "What is the best SMS API?"
    a: "There's no single best SMS API. It depends on your destinations, volume, and channels. Twilio is the most popular and best-documented; Vonage, Sinch, Bird, Plivo, and Infobip compete on price and regional coverage; AWS SNS suits teams already on AWS. For OTP specifically, cost and deliverability in your target countries usually matter more than brand."
  - q: "What is the cheapest SMS API?"
    a: "Per-message rates vary a lot by destination country, so the cheapest provider changes depending on where you send. Plivo is often the cheapest of the three; Bird's rates vary more and are sometimes well above Twilio's. Compare rates for your actual destinations rather than picking a single winner. Our SMS cost calculator does this across Twilio, Bird, and Plivo."
  - q: "What are good alternatives to Twilio?"
    a: "Vonage, Sinch, Bird (formerly MessageBird), Plivo, Infobip, and AWS SNS are the main alternatives. They compete on price, regional coverage, and support. The right choice depends on your destinations and whether you need extra channels like WhatsApp or voice. See our guide to Twilio Verify pricing and alternatives for the verification angle."
  - q: "Do SMS API providers support OTP and 2FA?"
    a: "Yes. Most offer either a raw SMS API you build OTP on top of, or a dedicated verification product (like Twilio Verify or Vonage Verify) that handles code generation and delivery. Verification products are simpler but add a per-verification fee on top of the message cost."
  - q: "Is WhatsApp cheaper than SMS through these providers?"
    a: "In most high-SMS-cost markets, yes. WhatsApp authentication messages are often 40–90% cheaper per message than SMS, and most major providers support both channels. A common pattern is WhatsApp-first delivery with SMS fallback, which captures the savings while keeping universal reach."

> **tl;dr**: The major SMS API providers (Twilio, Vonage, Sinch, Bird, Plivo, Infobip, and AWS SNS) all deliver messages reliably, so the real decision comes down to per-country pricing, coverage, and the channels you need. For OTP, the biggest cost lever isn't the provider. It's whether you can move traffic to a cheaper channel like WhatsApp.

If you need to send SMS from your app for OTPs, alerts, or notifications, you'll pick an SMS API provider to do it. The market is crowded and the marketing is loud, so this guide cuts to what matters: who the major providers are, how they differ, and how to choose without overpaying.

## The major SMS API providers

<div class="ag-table-wrap">
  <table class="ag-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Provider</th><th>Known for</th><th>Extra channels</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>Twilio</strong></td><td>Most popular, best docs and ecosystem; Verify product for OTP</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice, email, verify</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Vonage</strong></td><td>Strong global coverage; Verify API for OTP</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice, verify</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Sinch</strong></td><td>Enterprise-scale, tier-1 carrier routes</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice, verify</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Bird</strong> (ex-MessageBird)</td><td>Competitive pricing, strong in Europe</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice, email</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Plivo</strong></td><td>Developer-friendly, often lower per-message rates</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Infobip</strong></td><td>Broad channel support, enterprise focus</td><td>WhatsApp, RCS, voice, email</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>AWS SNS</strong></td><td>Simple SMS for teams already on AWS</td><td>Push, email (via AWS End User Messaging)</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

None of these is a wrong choice for basic sending. RCS support is now close to universal among the major providers too, so it's rarely a differentiator on its own. Providers differ mostly in price by country, depth of regional coverage, and how much hand-holding you get.

## How to actually choose

Ignore the leaderboards and weigh what applies to you:

- **Coverage where you send.** A provider that's cheap and reliable in the US might route poorly into Southeast Asia. Check your specific destinations.
- **Per-country pricing.** SMS is billed by the recipient's country, and the cheapest provider changes by market. There's no universal price winner.
- **Deliverability.** A low rate is meaningless if messages don't arrive. Look for tier-1 carrier routes in your key markets.
- **Channels beyond SMS.** If you'll want WhatsApp, RCS, or voice later, pick a provider that supports them under one account.
- **Verification products.** If you don't want to build OTP logic yourself, products like Twilio Verify or Vonage Verify handle it, for a per-verification fee. We compare that model in [Twilio Verify pricing and alternatives](/post/twilio-verify-pricing-and-alternatives).

## Pricing: it depends on the destination

Because rates are set per country, comparing providers means comparing your countries. Here are representative base SMS rates (excluding carrier surcharges) for a few markets:

<div class="ag-table-wrap">
  <table class="ag-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Country</th><th>Twilio</th><th>Bird</th><th>Plivo (from)</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>$0.0420</td><td>$0.0499</td><td>$0.0372</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Germany</td><td>$0.0940</td><td>$0.0999</td><td>$0.0950</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Singapore</td><td>$0.0415</td><td>$0.0519</td><td>$0.0516</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>$0.3603</td><td>$0.4106</td><td>$0.3333</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Notice there's no consistent winner. Plivo is cheapest in the UK and Indonesia, Twilio edges it out in Singapore, and the three land within a cent of each other in Germany. A single "cheapest SMS API" answer is misleading. Model it for your own traffic with the [SMS cost calculator](/tools/sms-cost-calculator), and see [SMS API Pricing Explained](/post/sms-api-pricing) for how the rates are built.

## The bigger lever: channel, not provider

Here's the part most provider comparisons miss. For OTP, switching providers might shave a few percent off your rate. Switching **channels** can cut the bill by most of it.

WhatsApp authentication messages are often 40–90% cheaper per message than SMS in high-cost markets (sometimes more), and WhatsApp isn't exposed to SMS pumping fraud. Most major providers support WhatsApp alongside SMS, so the winning pattern is usually **WhatsApp-first with SMS fallback** rather than hunting for the last cent on SMS rates. See [SMS OTP vs WhatsApp OTP](/post/sms-otp-vs-whatsapp-otp) and [WhatsApp API Pricing](/post/whatsapp-api-pricing).

If you'd rather not wire up multi-channel routing, fallback, and fraud protection on a raw SMS API, authentication platforms like [Authgear](https://www.authgear.com) handle OTP delivery out of the box. Authgear routes WhatsApp-first with automatic SMS fallback and built-in SMS pumping protection.

### Do SMS API providers support OTP and 2FA?
