faq:
  - q: "What is an OTP service provider?"
    a: "An OTP service provider is a service that generates, delivers, and checks one-time passcodes for you — over SMS, WhatsApp, voice, or email — so you don't have to build code generation, retry logic, and fraud protection yourself. Examples include Twilio Verify, Vonage Verify, Plivo Verify, and authentication platforms like Authgear that bundle OTP with login."
  - q: "How do I choose an OTP service provider?"
    a: "Compare five things: the channels you need (SMS, WhatsApp, voice, email), the pricing model (per-verification fee vs per-message), delivery rates in your users' countries, built-in protection against SMS pumping fraud, and whether you want a standalone verification API or OTP bundled into a full authentication platform."
  - q: "Who provides OTP services?"
    a: "CPaaS vendors (Twilio, Vonage, Sinch, Bird, Infobip, Plivo), SMS specialists like MSG91, developer platforms like Firebase and AWS, and customer identity platforms like Authgear. Meta also delivers OTPs directly through WhatsApp Business API authentication templates."
  - q: "What is the cheapest OTP service?"
    a: "Per delivered message, WhatsApp authentication templates are cheapest in most markets ($0.0034 in North America, $0.0014 in India as of July 2026). For SMS, providers without a per-verification platform fee — like Plivo (US SMS $0.0077) or MSG91 ($0.0065) — cost a fraction of Twilio Verify's $0.05-per-verification model at scale."
  - q: "Why am I getting fake OTP messages?"
    a: "Unrequested OTPs usually mean someone entered your number — either an attacker testing stolen credentials, an OTP bot trying to trick you into reading a code back, or SMS pumping fraud that triggers OTPs to premium-rate numbers. Never share a code you didn't request."

> **tl;dr** — For most teams in 2026: **Twilio Verify** is the most complete verification API (at a premium: $0.05 per verification plus channel fees), **Plivo Verify** is the value pick (no verification fee — you pay only ~$0.008 per US SMS), **MSG91** wins in India (₹0.20 per OTP SMS), and if you're sending high volumes, **WhatsApp authentication messages** are the cheapest channel outright ($0.0034 per message in North America, $0.0014 in India). If you want OTP *and* login, passkeys, and SSO in one place, use an authentication platform like **Authgear** instead of stitching a verification API onto your auth stack.

Picking an OTP service provider looks simple until the first invoice arrives. Two providers quoting "a cent per SMS" can differ by 6× in what a verification actually costs, because some charge a platform fee per verification on top of every message, some charge per message only, and some won't publish a price at all.

This guide compares the ten providers most teams shortlist in 2026, with pricing verified against official pricing pages in August 2026.

## What is an OTP service provider?

An OTP (one-time password) service provider generates, delivers, and checks single-use codes so you don't have to build that pipeline yourself. A good one handles the annoying parts: code generation and expiry, delivery across channels (SMS, WhatsApp, voice, email), retries and fallbacks when a message doesn't arrive, and fraud protection against [SMS pumping](/post/sms-pumping-attack).

One scope note: this list covers *managed verification services* — APIs that own the whole OTP lifecycle. If you just want a raw SMS gateway to send messages you generate yourself, that's a different comparison: see our guide to the [best SMS API providers](/post/best-sms-api-providers).

## How OTP pricing works

Almost every price difference between providers comes down to three components:

1. **A per-verification platform fee** — what you pay the provider for the verification logic itself. Twilio charges $0.05 per successful verification; Plivo charges $0.

2. **The channel fee** — what it costs to deliver the message. This varies enormously by channel and country: a US SMS runs $0.0065–0.02 delivered, a WhatsApp authentication message costs $0.0034 in North America, and the same WhatsApp message costs $0.0014 in India.

3. **Carrier surcharges** — US carriers add roughly $0.0035–0.005 per SMS on top of the provider's rate. Some providers itemize this; some bake it in. Always check.

The trap is scale. A $0.05 platform fee is invisible at 1,000 verifications a month and dominant at 1,000,000 — at that volume it's $50,000/month before a single SMS is sent. That's why the "cheapest" provider depends entirely on how many OTPs you send. (Plug your own volumes into our free [SMS cost calculator](/tools/sms-cost-calculator) to see the math for your case.)

## The providers

### 1. Twilio Verify

The default choice, and the most complete: one API covers SMS, voice, WhatsApp, email, push, TOTP, and silent network authentication, with SMS-pumping protection built in. You pay for the convenience — $0.05 per successful verification on top of channel fees, which for US SMS lands around $0.062 per verification all-in, and failed attempts still incur channel costs. Fine at low volume; at scale the platform fee usually becomes the biggest line on the bill. We've broken down the math and the escape routes in our [Twilio Verify pricing guide](/post/twilio-verify-pricing-and-alternatives), and compared the providers people switch to in [Twilio alternatives for SMS and OTP](/post/twilio-alternatives).

### 2. Vonage Verify

Twilio's closest like-for-like rival, with strong multi-channel failover (it can cascade SMS → RCS → voice automatically). The published "Verify Conversion" model charges €0.052 (~$0.061) per successful verification plus per-attempt channel rates; an all-in "Verify Success" model exists but is sales-quoted. Slightly more expensive than Twilio on paper for US SMS.

### 3. Plivo Verify

The value pick. Plivo charges **no verification fee at all** — you pay only the channel cost (US SMS $0.0077, WhatsApp $0.0143/conversation, voice $0.0115/min), and fraudulent or failed attempts aren't billed as verifications. At a million verifications a month, that's the difference between ~$10K and Twilio's ~$60K. The trade-off is a smaller channel set (no email, TOTP, or silent auth) and less brand-name enterprise polish.

### 4. MSG91

The India specialist. Domestic OTP SMS runs ₹0.25 per message at small volume down to ₹0.18 at scale (plus 18% GST and India's mandatory DLT registration), and its US rate of $0.0065 per SMS is the lowest published in this roundup. The OTP widget adds hosted verification UI at no extra fee. If most of your users are in India or Southeast Asia, MSG91 or a similar regional player will beat the global CPaaS vendors on price — often by 3–5×.

### 5. Firebase Phone Authentication

Convenient if you're already on Firebase — phone auth is wired into the SDK. But since phone-auth SMS moved to paid Blaze-plan billing, the pricing deserves attention: $0.01 per SMS in the US is fair, but **$0.07 per SMS in India** is roughly 50× what a domestic Indian provider charges — a common source of surprise bills for apps that grow an Indian user base. You're billed per SMS *sent*, so retries bill again. SMS is also the only channel: no WhatsApp, voice, or email fallback.

### 6. AWS End User Messaging

Not a verification service — a messaging pipe ($0.02 per US SMS all-in) on which you build your own OTP generation, expiry, retry, and fraud logic. Choose it only if you're deeply AWS-native and want full control; owning SMS-pumping defense yourself is a bigger job than it looks. (Note: SMS pricing moved from the old SNS page to the newer End User Messaging product.)

### 7. Sinch Verification

Solid infrastructure with one distinctive feature: **flash-call verification** (an incoming call whose number contains the code, auto-detected on Android) that can undercut SMS in some markets. Verification pricing, however, is per-attempt and only visible in the dashboard rate sheets — effectively quote-based. Published US SMS starts at $0.0078 plus carrier fees.

### 8. Bird Verify (formerly MessageBird)

Bird's Verify product is in preview and not on the public price list — you'll be talking to sales. Email, SMS, and WhatsApp are supported, with voice rolling out. Hard to recommend sight-unseen on price, but worth a quote if you already run on Bird's CRM/messaging stack.

### 9. Infobip

The enterprise option, strong in Europe, Asia, and channels others don't carry (Viber, RCS). Publishes no rates — pricing is entirely quote-based behind a login. Expect competitive numbers at enterprise volume and little transparency below it.

### 10. Authgear

A different category: Authgear is a customer identity platform, so OTP arrives as part of the login box rather than as a standalone API — SMS, [WhatsApp OTP](/features/whatsapp-otp/), email, and TOTP, alongside passkeys, SSO, and session management. There's no separate per-verification platform fee to reason about; messaging is billed as usage on top of plan pricing. The cost lever is structural: WhatsApp delivery at Meta's authentication rates ($0.0034 in North America, $0.0014 in India) instead of SMS, and passkeys plus remembered devices that cut how many OTPs you send at all. The honest trade-off: if you only want a verification endpoint and nothing else, a standalone API is simpler; if you're building or replacing your whole auth stack anyway, bundling OTP into it usually costs less than running an auth platform *plus* a verify API.

## How to choose an OTP service provider

Five questions cover most of the decision:

- **Which channels do your users actually have?** SMS reaches everyone; WhatsApp is far cheaper where it's ubiquitous (India, Brazil, much of Asia); voice covers accessibility; email is nearly free but slower.
- **Per-verification fee or per-message?** Estimate your monthly verifications and do the multiplication. Above ~100K/month, a $0.05 platform fee is usually the whole story.
- **Where are your users?** Delivery rates and prices swing wildly by country. A provider that's cheap in the US can be expensive or unreliable in India, and vice versa — this is where regional specialists earn their place.
- **Who absorbs fraud?** [SMS pumping](/post/sms-pumping-attack) can silently multiply your OTP bill. Prefer providers with pumping protection included — or a design that doesn't bill you for fraudulent attempts.
- **Standalone API or bundled with auth?** If OTP is one feature of a login system you also have to build, compare the *combined* cost of an auth platform against auth-stack-plus-verify-API.

## How to cut OTP costs

Whichever provider you pick, the biggest savings come from sending fewer and cheaper messages, not from shaving the per-message rate:

- **Switch channels.** WhatsApp authentication messages cost a fraction of SMS in most non-US markets. [Silent network authentication](/post/silent-network-authentication) removes the message entirely on mobile.
- **Send fewer OTPs.** Passkeys and remembered devices mean returning users skip the code. Every verification you don't send is 100% saved.
- **Match provider to geography.** Route India through a domestic provider or WhatsApp, not a US-priced global API.
- **Block pumping fraud early.** Rate-limit by number range and monitor conversion by carrier — see [how OTP bots work](/post/otp-bot-explained).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an OTP service provider?

An OTP service provider is a service that generates, delivers, and checks one-time passcodes for you — over SMS, WhatsApp, voice, or email — so you don't have to build code generation, retry logic, and fraud protection yourself. Examples include Twilio Verify, Vonage Verify, Plivo Verify, and authentication platforms like Authgear that bundle OTP with login.

### How do I choose an OTP service provider?

Compare five things: the channels you need (SMS, WhatsApp, voice, email), the pricing model (per-verification fee vs per-message), delivery rates in your users' countries, built-in protection against SMS pumping fraud, and whether you want a standalone verification API or OTP bundled into a full authentication platform.

### Who provides OTP services?

CPaaS vendors (Twilio, Vonage, Sinch, Bird, Infobip, Plivo), SMS specialists like MSG91, developer platforms like Firebase and AWS, and customer identity platforms like Authgear. Meta also delivers OTPs directly through WhatsApp Business API authentication templates.

### What is the cheapest OTP service?

Per delivered message, WhatsApp authentication templates are cheapest in most markets ($0.0034 in North America, $0.0014 in India as of July 2026). For SMS, providers without a per-verification platform fee — like Plivo (US SMS $0.0077) or MSG91 ($0.0065) — cost a fraction of Twilio Verify's $0.05-per-verification model at scale.

### Why am I getting fake OTP messages?

Unrequested OTPs usually mean someone entered your number — either an attacker testing stolen credentials, an OTP bot trying to trick you into reading a code back, or SMS pumping fraud that triggers OTPs to premium-rate numbers. Never share a code you didn't request.
