faq:
  - q: "How much does Twilio Verify cost?"
    a: "Twilio Verify charges $0.05 per successful verification (volume discounts available) on top of the channel fee. For SMS in the US that's $0.05 + about $0.0083 per message, so roughly $0.058 per verification. The $0.05 platform fee is charged per successful verification regardless of channel; SMS and voice attempts are billed even if they aren't delivered."
  - q: "What counts as a 'successful verification' in Twilio Verify?"
    a: "For an OTP channel, a successful verification is one where the user enters the correct code and Verify confirms it. You are charged the $0.05 verification fee on success, plus the channel cost for every attempt sent — so failed or abandoned attempts still incur SMS/voice charges even though no $0.05 fee applies."
  - q: "Is Twilio Verify expensive?"
    a: "At low volume it's cheap and convenient. At scale, the $0.05-per-verification platform fee usually dominates the bill — for US SMS it's roughly 6× the cost of the SMS itself. Sending OTPs directly (your own Cloud API / SMS gateway) or through an auth platform that doesn't charge a separate per-verification fee is often much cheaper above ~100K verifications a month."
  - q: "What are the best alternatives to Twilio Verify?"
    a: "Depending on your goal: other verification APIs (Vonage Verify, Sinch/MessageBird Verify) if you want a like-for-like swap; a full authentication platform like Authgear if you want OTP plus passkeys, SSO, and fraud protection in one; or building directly on the WhatsApp Cloud API / an SMS gateway if you want the lowest per-message cost and are willing to own the routing and fraud logic."
  - q: "How can I reduce Twilio Verify costs?"
    a: "Cut the number of verifications (passkeys and remembered devices mean returning users don't need an OTP), route OTPs over cheaper channels like WhatsApp instead of SMS, negotiate volume discounts, and — if the per-verification fee is your biggest line item — evaluate sending directly or via a platform without that fee."

> **tl;dr** — Twilio Verify costs **$0.05 per successful verification, plus channel fees** (US SMS ≈ $0.05 + $0.0083; WhatsApp ≈ $0.05 + $0.0034). That flat per-verification fee is convenient at low volume but dominates the bill at scale — often 6× the cost of the SMS itself. The cheapest alternatives cut verification *volume* (passkeys), the *channel* (WhatsApp over SMS), or the per-verification fee (send direct).

Twilio Verify is one of the easiest ways to add OTP and multi-channel verification to an app — one API handles SMS, voice, email, WhatsApp, and more, with fraud protection built in. The convenience is real. So is the bill once you scale.

This guide breaks down what Twilio Verify actually costs in 2026, when that cost is worth it, and the main alternatives if it isn't.

## How Twilio Verify pricing works

Twilio Verify is pay-as-you-go, with two charges stacked on every verification:

1. **A $0.05 fee per successful verification** (volume discounts available). This is charged when the user enters the correct code and Verify confirms it — regardless of channel.
2. **The channel fee** for actually sending the message, which depends on the channel and destination country.

Here's how that looks per channel (US prices):

<div class="ag-table-wrap">
<table class="ag-table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Channel</th><th>Per successful verification</th><th>+ Channel fee (US)</th><th>Billing note</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>SMS</td><td>$0.05</td><td>~$0.0083 / message</td><td>Attempts billed even if not delivered</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voice</td><td>$0.05</td><td>Per-minute voice rate</td><td>Attempts billed even if not delivered</td></tr>
<tr><td>WhatsApp</td><td>$0.05</td><td>~$0.0034 / auth template</td><td>Billed only on delivery</td></tr>
<tr><td>Email</td><td>$0.05</td><td>Included</td><td>—</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

The key thing to notice: **the $0.05 platform fee is usually bigger than the message it's attached to.** A US SMS verification costs about $0.058 total — and $0.05 of that is the Verify fee, not the text message. In cheap-SMS markets like India, where a message can cost a fraction of a cent, the $0.05 fee is the entire cost for all practical purposes.

> ⚠️ **Watch failed attempts.** The $0.05 fee only applies to *successful* verifications, but SMS and voice attempts are billed whether or not they're delivered or completed. Abandoned signups and undelivered messages still cost you channel fees.

## What Twilio Verify costs at scale

Say you run 100,000 successful SMS verifications a month in the US:

- Verification fee: 100,000 × $0.05 = **$5,000**
- SMS channel: ~100,000 × $0.0083 = **$830**
- **Total ≈ $5,830/month**

The $0.05 fee is ~86% of that bill. Scale up and the pattern holds:

- **500K verifications/month** → ≈ $29,150 ($25,000 fee + ~$4,150 SMS)
- **1M verifications/month** → ≈ $58,300 ($50,000 fee + ~$8,300 SMS)

For comparison, sending those same 100,000 OTPs yourself over SMS — no per-verification platform fee — is roughly **$830** in the US, or even less over WhatsApp. The gap is entirely the Verify fee. That's the trade-off: you're paying for the orchestration, fraud tooling, and multi-channel fallback, not for the messages.

## What you actually get for the fee

It's worth being fair about what the $0.05 buys, because for some teams it's a bargain:

- **One API, many channels.** SMS, voice, email, WhatsApp, push, and TOTP behind a single integration, with automatic channel fallback.
- **Fraud Guard.** Twilio's fraud protection blocks SMS pumping and abusive traffic without you building detection yourself.
- **Prebuilt flows.** Rate limiting, retry logic, code generation, and delivery handling are done for you.
- **No infrastructure.** No WhatsApp Business Account setup, no template approvals, no gateway contracts.

If you're small, moving fast, or verification is a minor part of your product, that's genuinely worth $0.05.

## When Twilio Verify makes sense — and when it doesn't

**Good fit:**
- Low-to-moderate verification volume (under ~50K/month) where the absolute cost is small.
- You need multiple channels immediately and don't want to build fallback logic.
- You want fraud protection out of the box and have no appetite to build it.

**Poor fit:**
- High volume, where the per-verification fee compounds into five or six figures a month.
- You already run an authentication system and only need the messaging.
- Most of your users are in cheap-SMS markets, where the $0.05 fee dwarfs the channel cost.

## Twilio Verify alternatives (2026)

Comparing providers one by one? Our [Twilio alternatives for SMS and OTP](/post/twilio-alternatives) switching guide covers each in detail.

If the per-verification fee is your problem, there are three broad directions:

<div class="ag-table-wrap">
<table class="ag-table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Alternative</th><th>What it is</th><th>Best when</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Authgear</strong></td><td>Full authentication platform: OTP (WhatsApp-first with SMS fallback), passkeys, SSO, MFA, and SMS pumping protection</td><td>You want to cut both the channel cost and the number of OTPs, and consolidate auth in one place</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vonage Verify / Sinch / MessageBird Verify</td><td>Verification APIs comparable to Twilio Verify</td><td>You want a like-for-like swap and are shopping on per-verification price</td></tr>
<tr><td>Firebase Authentication / AWS (Cognito + SNS)</td><td>Cloud-provider auth with phone/SMS verification</td><td>You're already deep in that cloud ecosystem</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direct: WhatsApp Cloud API + SMS gateway</td><td>Build routing and verification yourself on raw messaging APIs</td><td>You want the lowest per-message cost and can own the fraud and fallback logic</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

A like-for-like verification API swap saves you a bit on the per-verification fee, but you're still paying one. The bigger savings come from removing the per-verification fee entirely (send direct) or from sending far fewer, cheaper messages.

## How to actually cut verification costs

Whatever you switch to, the same levers apply:

1. **Send fewer verifications.** Every OTP you don't send is 100% saved. Passkeys and biometrics let returning users skip the code entirely; remembered devices and longer sessions mean you only verify new devices and recovery. At scale this cuts verification volume — and cost — dramatically.
2. **Route over WhatsApp, not SMS.** WhatsApp authentication messages cost 50–90% less than SMS in most markets. Keep SMS as a fallback for users without WhatsApp. (See [WhatsApp API pricing](/post/whatsapp-api-pricing) for the per-country numbers.)
3. **Drop the per-verification fee where you can.** If a flat platform fee is your biggest line item and you have the engineering capacity, sending directly removes it.
4. **Keep fraud protection.** Whatever you move to, don't lose SMS pumping protection — bot-triggered sends can erase your savings. (See [what an SMS pumping attack is](/post/sms-pumping-attack).)

> Authgear covers these in one platform: WhatsApp-first OTP with automatic SMS fallback, passkeys and biometrics to cut verification volume for returning users, and built-in SMS pumping protection — without a separate per-verification fee stacked on top.
